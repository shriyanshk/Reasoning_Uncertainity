Package Definitions

abc2.1 = Implements several ABC algorithms for performing parameter estimation, model selection, and goodness-of-fit. Cross-validation tools are also available for measuring the accuracy of ABC estimates, and to calculate the misclassification probabilities of different models.
(Tool for approximate Bayesian Computation)

adespatial - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adespatial/adespatial.pdf
Multivariate Multiscale Spatial analyiss - Tools for the multiscale spatial analysis of multivariate data. Several methods are based on the use of a spatial weighting matrix and its eigenvector decomposition (Moran's Eigenvectors Maps, MEM).

bnlearn - an R package for learning the graphical structure of Bayesian networks, estimate their parameters and perform some useful inference.

bnspatial - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnspatial/vignettes/bnspatial.html
Spatial Implementation of Bayesian Networks and Mapping - Package for the spatial implementation of Bayesian Networks and mapping in geographical space. It makes maps of expected value (or most likely state) given known and unknown conditions, maps of uncertainty measured as coefficient of variation or Shannon index (entropy), maps of probability associated to any states of any node of the network. Some additional features are provided as well: parallel processing options, data discretization routines and function wrappers designed for users with minimal knowledge of the R language. Outputs can be exported to any common GIS format.

CompRandFld - Composite-Likelihood Based Analysis of Random Fields
A set of procedures for the analysis of Random Fields using likelihood and non-standard likelihood methods is provided. Spatial analysis often involves dealing with large dataset. Therefore even simple studies may be too computationally demanding. Composite likelihood inference is emerging as a useful tool for mitigating such computational problems. This methodology shows satisfactory results when compared with other techniques such as the tapering method.

CRF - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CRF/CRF.pdf
Conditional Random Fields - Implements modeling and computational tools for conditional random fields (CRF) model as well as other probabilistic undirected graphical models of discrete data with pairwise and unary potentials.

deal - Learning Bayesian Networks with Mixed Variables
Bayesian networks with continuous and/or discrete variables can be learned and compared from data.(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deal/deal.pdf)

depmix - Dependent Mixture Models
Fits (multigroup) mixtures of latent or hidden Markov models on mixed categorical and continuous (timeseries) data. The Rdonlp2 package can optionally be used for optimization of the log-likelihood and is available from R-forge. 

depmixS4 - Dependent Mixture Models - Hidden Markov Models of GLMs and Other Distributions in S4
Fits latent (hidden) Markov models on mixed categorical and continuous (time series) data, otherwise known as dependent mixture models.(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/depmixS4/depmixS4.pdf)

ebdbNet - Empirical Bayes Estimation of Dynamic Bayesian Networks
Infer the adjacency matrix of a network from time course data using an empirical Bayes estimation procedure based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks.(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ebdbNet/ebdbNet.pdf)

equSA - Estimate Directed and Undirected Graphical Models and Construct Networks
Provides an equivalent measure of partial correlation coefficients for high-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models to learn and visualize the underlying relationships between variables from single or multiple datasets.
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/equSA/equSA.pdf)

excursions - Excursion Sets and Contour Credibility Regions for Random Fields
Functions that compute probabilistic excursion sets, contour credibility regions, contour avoiding regions, and simultaneous confidence bands for latent Gaussian random processes and fields. The package also contains functions that calculate these quantities for models estimated with the INLA package.
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/excursions/excursions.pdf)

GiRaF - Gibbs Random Fields Analysis
Allows calculation on, and sampling from Gibbs Random Fields, and more precisely general homogeneous Potts model. The primary tool is the exact computation of the intractable normalising constant for small rectangular lattices. Beside the latter function, it contains method that give exact sample from the likelihood for small enough rectangular lattices or approximate sample from the likelihood using MCMC samplers for large lattices.
